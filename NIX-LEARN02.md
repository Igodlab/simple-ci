# Checkpoint 2

### Review of checkpoint 1

Until checkpoint 1 we got installed `nix`, `cabal`, `cabal2nix` & `nix-prefetch-git`. Then we wrote our configurations for nix, Haskell dependencies and our new package reference. All these in
- `config.nix`
- `default.nix`
- `shell.nix`

Lastly, we run `cabal configure`, `cabal build` and finally accesed the repl for our `Main.hs` script with `cabal repl`.

Congrats! This is the end of **Checkpoint 2**
